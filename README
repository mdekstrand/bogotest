Bogus Testing Framework - a unit testing framework for C

This framework was written to take the best ideas from CUnit, Check, and the
various xUnit systems.  Features include:
 * Fixtures with setup and teardown functions
 * Forking - each test runs in its own process
 * Pre-written main function - all you write are tests

The basic idea: write your tests using the various BT_ASSERT macros.  Define an
array, bogotest_suites, of BTSuiteInfo structures defining your test suites.
Link against libbogotest.a, and run the resulting program.

BOGOTEST COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

BogoTest's main function currently recognizes two command line options. '-v'
turns on verbose output.  '-F' disables forking (useful for debugging a failing
test).

GENERAL HINTS

I find it useful to just clone the bogotest tree in to a subdirectory of my
project's source tree and reference it there.

INSTALLATION

If you really feel like installing the library somehow, you can type `make
install` to install it to $PREFIX (defaults to /usr/local).
